This is still a work in progress. Here's an overview.

Main sets up the simulator and asks the user what to do.
Simulator is the bulk of the interaction. It holds the map
and the robots and does the graph optimization.
Graph is a generalized graph solver for undirected gaussian
error graphs. It is not terribly efficient as it simply uses
pinv to invert the sparse matrix as opposed to colamd and QR
as is recommended in various papers.
