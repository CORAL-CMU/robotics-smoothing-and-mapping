This doesnt work with covariance -- only with independant noise.

Graph optimization:
node values
edge observation
edge prediction function
edge error function
edge error jacobians w.r.t. each node



TODO:

graph optimization!
    Jacobians all look good now.
    check with spiral and short

    look like maybe an issue with the landmarks not updating

    look at the deltas, make sure they're updated properly
    colamd and QR to solve
